**Title: Mathematical Modeling of CNA Expression Variability in Skin Cancer Using Network and Clustering Approaches**

This project explores copy number alterations (CNA) and gene expression variability in skin cancer using a mathematical and network-based approach. Instead of traditional correlation or machine learning methods, this study applies:
>Variability analysis to classify genes based on expression fluctuations.
>Clustering techniques to group genes with similar CNA-expression behavior.
>Graph theory-based network analysis to map gene interactions.
>Patient clustering to identify potential subtypes for precision oncology.
These analyses help uncover key oncogenes, tumor suppressors, and potential therapeutic targets, contributing to a better understanding of skin cancer mechanisms.

Contents
This repository includes:
✔ Processed data files with CNA and gene expression values.
✔ Scripts for analysis, including gene clustering, network construction, and patient grouping.
✔ Visualizations of gene networks, variability, and clustering results.

Key Findings
✔ Identified high-variability genes as potential oncogenes/tumor suppressors.
✔ Network analysis revealed key hub genes involved in cancer progression.
✔ Patient clustering suggested distinct skin cancer subtypes, aiding precision medicine.
